      <i> "Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in CS, excited to be here and to help introduce you to the field. I first learned to program by writing web scrapers as an undergrad at UCLA, and then I got involved in a medical imaging lab that introduced me to research in CS. Since then I have worked as a software developer at a number of companies (including Procore in the SB area), and I have also worked as a researcher in the areas of machine learning and computer vision. Learning to write code is very rewarding and eye-opening, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience with you." </i>
